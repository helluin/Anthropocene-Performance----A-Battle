# Anthropocene-Performance----A-Battle

This patch is used for a digital performance piece at Tisch Dance Dept. Video documentation is in process. 

This performance features a battle that's both happening with the sound and with the visuals.

One performer, the drummer, embodies mother nature and the other, the violinist, represents human beings. When the drummer beats the drum, the projection shows pictures of nature's beauty. When the violinist improvises noisy sound and inharmonious chords, a black-and-white video of industrial pollution would emerge. Eventually, the whole screen would be taken over by the pollution picture. The drumer would collapse. And so will the violinist -- like virus can no longer live if the host dies.
